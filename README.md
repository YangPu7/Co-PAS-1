# Co-Pilot for Perovskite Additive Screener （Co-PAS）

This repository is created by Yang Pu, Zhe Liu, Yifan Zhou, et al. 

The code is written by Yang Pu at the Northwestern Polytechnical Univeristy. 

Co-PAS is an ML-driven framework designed to accelerate additive screening for perovskite solar cells, which integrates a Molecular Scaffold Classifier, Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder for Molecular Structure Encoding, Predictive Regressor for Molecular Properties (Donor Number, Dipole Moment, etc.)
